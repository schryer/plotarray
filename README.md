# plotarray: Package that aids in the creation of matplotlib plots.

## What it is
**plotarray** is a Python package that provides a method of separating data
from layout while making matplotlib plots. It implements a dictionary type
interface inspired by plotly. 

## Main Features
Here are the main things provided by this package:

  - Saving and retreval of plot data using **HDF5** files via the `h5py` Python package
  - One generic function `make_plot_array` that lays out an array of plots of various types.
  - Examples (to be included soon...).
